# Words_Xamarin_MVVM
A small app to demonstrate the MVVM architecture in the Xamarin crossplatform (iOS, Android) development.

# Warning
Before use, please insert a valid API key to the [ApiCommunicationService file](Words_MVVM/Services/ApiCommunicationService.cs).

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries, for instance HttpClient from Microsoft for the networking and NewtonSoft for the transitions. The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of Xamarin with the presentation of some platform-specific code. The main goal is to show a really simple MVVM architectural pattern in practice in the crossplatform world. Keywords: MVVM, Command pattern, Converter, Data binding.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests will be coming in the near future.
